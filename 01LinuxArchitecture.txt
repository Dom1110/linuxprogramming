=> Linux Architecture. Components - bird eye view.

Hardware: This is the physical layer of computers where all the physical components reside.

Kernel: The core part of Linux, responsible for managing 
the system's resources and  interacting with hardware.

System Libraries: These provide a set of standard functions that user applications 
can use to perform system-level tasks.

Shell: This is a user interface to the kernel. 
It takes commands from the user and executes the system's programs. 
Different types of shells provide various features, but all serve as the command interpreter 
between the user and the system.

System Utilities: These are tools and programs that perform individual, 
specialized tasks that users may invoke via the shell or directly as background services.

Users: Users interact with the shell using commands, 
and they are an essential part of the system's ecosystem. 
Their privileges and environment are managed by the system, 
but they are the actors who make use of the architecture to perform work.

User Applications: 
These are the high-level applications that users interact with directly, 
such as office suites, browsers, and games. 
They often use system libraries and utilities to function and are accessed 
via a shell or a graphical user interface.
