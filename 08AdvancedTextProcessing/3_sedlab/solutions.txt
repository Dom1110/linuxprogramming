1. Code Refactoring
Solution: $ sed 's/Debug:/Info:/g' app.py

Explanation:

sed: The stream editor command used for parsing and transforming text.

's/Debug:/Info:/g': This is a sed expression for substitution:

s: The substitute command.
Debug:: The pattern to search for.
Info:: The replacement string.
g: Stands for "global", meaning it will replace all occurrences in a line, 
not just the first one.
app.py: The input file which sed will operate on.

When this command is run, every occurrence of the string "Debug:" in app.py 
will be replaced by "Info:", and the result will be printed to the console. 
The file app.py remains unchanged unless -i option is used with sed.

2. Configuration Management
Solution: 
$ sed 's#http://localhost:8080#http://production.database.com#g' settings.ini > settings_new.ini

Explanation:

sed: The stream editor.

's#http://localhost:8080#http://production.database.com#g': 
This is a sed substitution expression similar to the first, 
but note the use of the # delimiter instead of /. We've used a different delimiter 
because the search and replace strings contain forward slashes, 
and using / as a delimiter would complicate the expression.

settings.ini: The input file that sed will operate on.

> settings_new.ini: This redirects the output (the modified content) to a new file 
named settings_new.ini. Without this, the result would simply be printed to the console.

When the command is run, it will search for the database 
URL "http://localhost:8080" in settings.ini and replace 
it with "http://production.database.com", 
saving the modified content to settings_new.ini.

3. Code Analysis
Solution: $ sed -n '/TODO/p' app.py

Explanation:

sed -n: The -n option tells sed to suppress automatic printing of pattern space 
(i.e., it won't print anything unless explicitly told to).

/TODO/p: This is a sed expression to search and print:

/TODO/: The pattern to search for.
p: Print command. This tells sed to print lines that match the pattern.
app.py: The input file.

When this command is run, only the lines containing the word "TODO" 
in app.py will be printed to the console.

4. Function Renaming
Solution: $ sed 's/connect_database/establish_database_connection/g' app.py

Explanation:

sed: The stream editor.

's/connect_database/establish_database_connection/g'

This is another sed substitution expression:

s: The substitute command.
connect_database: The pattern to search for (the original function name).
establish_database_connection: The replacement string (the new function name).
g: Stands for "global".
app.py: The input file.

When run, this command will replace all occurrences of the function name 
"connect_database" with "establish_database_connection" in app.py and 
print the modified content to the console. 
The original file remains unchanged unless the -i option is used.
