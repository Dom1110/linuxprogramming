The tar command in Linux is designed to store and preserve file permissions (like read-only statuses), 
ownerships, and dates, among other metadata. When you extract the files from a tar archive, they will retain the permissions 
they had when they were archived, including read-only status if you set it using something like "chmod."

On the other hand, zip doesn't preserve all file metadata by default. While zip can store some basic permissions, 
it's not as comprehensive as tar, especially in the context of a Unix-like system such as Linux. If file permissions are crucial, 
like in system backups or software distribution, tar is usually the preferred format on Linux systems. If you're transferring 
files between different systems or file permission preservation is not a priority, zip's compatibility and ease of use might be more beneficial.

side-by-side comparison of how you'd use the tar and zip commands to archive files in Linux:

To Archive Files:

tar:

tar -cvf archive_name.tar /path/to/directory_or_file
Explanation: c creates an archive, v provides verbose output, f allows you to specify the archive file's name.

zip:

zip -r archive_name.zip /path/to/directory_or_file
Explanation: -r (or --recurse-paths) tells zip to travel down directories recursively and compress everything in them.

To Archive and Compress Files:

tar with gzip compression (creates a .tar.gz):

tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz /path/to/directory_or_file
Explanation: z applies gzip compression.

tar with bzip2 compression (creates a .tar.bz2):

tar -cjvf archive_name.tar.bz2 /path/to/directory_or_file
Explanation: j applies bzip2 compression.

zip (compression is inherent):

zip -r archive_name.zip /path/to/directory_or_file
To Extract Files:

tar:

tar -xvf archive_name.tar -C /path/to/destination_directory
Explanation: x extracts files, C specifies the directory to extract to.

zip:

unzip archive_name.zip -d /path/to/destination_directory
Explanation: -d specifies the directory to extract files to.

These are basic examples. Both tar and zip offer many more options that you can explore using their respective man pages 
(man tar or man zip in the terminal). The choice between
using tar and zip can depend on your specific needs in terms of compression, 
preservation of file attributes, and cross-platform compatibility.
