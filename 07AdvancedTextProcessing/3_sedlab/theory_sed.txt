The sed (stream editor) command in Linux is a powerful utility 
for parsing and transforming text in data streams or files. 
It works on the basis of applying a script of editing commands to each line of input. 
Here's a brief primer on using sed:

1. Basic Syntax
sed [OPTIONS] 'command' file

2. Common Operations
a) Print lines containing a specific pattern:
sed -n '/pattern/p' file

b) Delete lines containing a specific pattern:
sed '/pattern/d' file

c) Substitute (replace) first occurrence of a pattern in each line:
sed 's/pattern/replacement/' file

d) Substitute all occurrences of a pattern in each line:
sed 's/pattern/replacement/g' file

e) In-Place Editing
By default, sed outputs the result to standard output. 
If you want to modify the file in place, use the -i option:

sed -i 's/pattern/replacement/' file
