Lab4 : Building a Debian Package with a Simple C++ Program using CMake and Clang++

Objective:
In this lab, you will create a Debian package from a simple C++ program's source code.

1. Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have the necessary utilities and compilers installed:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dh-make fakeroot build-essential clang cmake


2. Write a Simple C++ Program:
Create a file named myprogram.cpp with the following content:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, Debian!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

3. Create a CMakeLists.txt:
Create a CMakeLists.txt with the following content:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProgram)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "clang++")
add_executable(myprogram myprogram.cpp)
install(TARGETS myprogram DESTINATION bin)


4. Create Source Tarball:
Package the myprogram.cpp and CMakeLists.txt into a tarball named myprogram-1.0.tar.gz:

mkdir myprogram-1.0
cp myprogram.cpp CMakeLists.txt myprogram-1.0
tar czvf myprogram-1.0.tar.gz myprogram-1.0

5. Build the Debian Package:
a) Create a Working Directory:

rm -rf WORK && mkdir WORK && cd WORK
cp ../myprogram-1.0.tar.gz .

b) Expand the Source Tarball:

tar xvf myprogram-1.0.tar.gz

c) Navigate into Expanded Directory:

cd myprogram-1.0

d) Build the Package:

dh_make -f ../*myprogram-1.0.tar.gz
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us

6. Install and Verify the Package:
a) Install the Package:

cd ..
sudo dpkg --install *.deb

b) Verify Installation:

myprogram
Output should be: Hello, Debian!

c) Uninstall the Package:
If you have multiple packages depending on myprogram, 
you might have to remove all of them before you can successfully remove myprogram. 
You can check the dependencies using the following command:

apt rdepends myprogram

You should remove the myprogram-dbgsym package first before removing the myprogram package. 
Here's how you can do it:
sudo dpkg --remove myprogram-dbgsym
sudo dpkg --remove myprogram


The first command removes the myprogram-dbgsym package, which has a dependency on myprogram. 
Once the dependent package is removed, the second command should successfully remove 
the myprogram package without encountering any dependency issues.


Conclusion:
In this lab, you have successfully created, built, installed, and uninstalled 
a Debian package containing a simple C++ program, using cmake and clang++.
