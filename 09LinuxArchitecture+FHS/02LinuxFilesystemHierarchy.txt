=> Linux FileSystemHierarhy or LHS

The filesystem hierarchy standardizes the layout of directories and files in a Linux system, 
which reflects the architecture's modularity and organization. 
Here's how the filesystem hierarchy connects with the Linux architecture:

/ (Root): 
The root directory is at the base of the filesystem hierarchy. 
Everything on a Linux system falls under the root directory.

/bin and /usr/bin (User Binaries): 
These directories contain essential user command binaries that are necessary 
for the system to boot and run. It connects with the shell in the architecture 
as it contains the binaries that users directly interact with.

/sbin and /usr/sbin (System Binaries): 
Here lie the system binaries that are usually run by the root user for system administration. 
This relates to the system utilities in the architecture, which perform specialized tasks.

/etc (Configuration Files): 
This directory holds the system-wide configuration files read by applications at startup. 
Itâ€™s a critical part of the system utilities layer, 
affecting how the system behaves for users and the shell.

/dev (Device Files): 
In Linux, hardware devices are treated as files, and the /dev directory contains these device files. 

/proc and /sys (System Information): 
These virtual filesystems don't contain real files but are interfaces 
to system and process information managed by the kernel.

/var (Variable Files): 
This includes files that are expected to grow over time, 
such as logs, spool files, and cache data. It's part of the system's ongoing operation,
tying back to the process and memory management aspects of the kernel.

/home (User Home Directories): 
Each user has a directory in /home, where their personal files are stored. 
This relates directly to the user component of the architecture, providing a space for user data.

/lib and /usr/lib (Libraries): 
These directories contain library files that support the binaries in /bin and /sbin. 
They are connected to the system libraries in the architecture, which provide 
higher-level functions to the system's programs.

/boot (Boot Loader Files): 
Contains the files needed to boot the operating system. 
It's closely related to the kernel component since the kernel itself is 
typically stored here along with the boot loader.

/tmp (Temporary Files): 
Used by applications to store temporary files, 
which aligns with the process management function of 
the kernel and its management of system resources.

Each directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy has a specific purpose 
and contains a certain type of file or directory entries, 
which helps maintain a well-organized system that reflects the architecture's principles.
