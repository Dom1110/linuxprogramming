OpenSSL
OpenSSL is a robust, full-featured open-source toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, 
along with a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.
It's widely used for securing communications over computer networks and for various cryptographic operations.

AES-256-CBC with Salt in OpenSSL

AES-256-CBC:

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard, a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe.
256: Refers to the key size â€“ 256 bits in this case, offering a high level of security.
CBC: Cipher Block Chaining, a mode of operation for block ciphers. 
It means each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. 
This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point, enhancing security.


Salt in Encryption:
A "salt" is a random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or passphrase.
Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. In the context of OpenSSL's encryption, it adds an extra layer of security.
When you encrypt a file with OpenSSL using a password, the salt ensures that even if two files are encrypted with the same password, 
the encrypted files will be different, due to the use of different salt values.
