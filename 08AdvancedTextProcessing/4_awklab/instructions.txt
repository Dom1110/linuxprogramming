AWK Lab Exercise Instructions

Objective: Develop a solid understanding of 
AWK's capabilities by analyzing pseudo-log files.

Setup:

1. Familiarize yourself with the structure of a hypothetical log file, application.log:
   Format: [TIMESTAMP] [LOG_LEVEL] [MODULE] Message
   Example: [2022-09-03 12:30:45] [ERROR] [AUTH] Failed login attempt.

2. Recognize that logs can be vital for software developers to debug and 
monitor system behavior.

Tasks:

1. Identify and list all unique log levels in the log file.
2. Extract and display all logs originating from the DATABASE module.
3. Determine the number of unique error messages logged by the AUTH module.
4. Rank and display the software modules based on the number of logs they generated.
