OpenSSL
OpenSSL is a robust, full-featured open-source toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, 
along with a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.
It's widely used for securing communications over computer networks and for various cryptographic operations.


AES-256-CBC:

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard, a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe.
256: Refers to the key size â€“ 256 bits, offering a high level of security.
CBC: Cipher Block Chaining, a mode of operation for block ciphers. 
It means each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. 
This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point, enhancing security.


Salt in Encryption:
A "salt" is a random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or passphrase.
Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. In the context of OpenSSL's encryption, it adds an extra layer of security.
When you encrypt a file with OpenSSL using a password, the salt ensures that even if two files are encrypted with the same password, 
the encrypted files will be different, due to the use of different salt values.


RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.
It's named after its inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, 
who first publicly described it in 1977. 


Here's a brief overview of how RSA works:
Key Generation:

RSA involves a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.
The public key can be shared with anyone and is used for encrypting data.
The private key is kept secret and is used for decrypting data.
