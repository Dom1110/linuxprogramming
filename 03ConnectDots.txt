LinuxArchitecture + Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) 


Here is how each aspect of the FHS connects with the broader Linux architecture:


=> Linux Architecture Component: Kernel and System Files

/boot:
This directory contains the static bootloader and kernel files necessary to boot the system, 
directly connected to the Linux kernel layer in the architecture.

/lib, /lib64: 
These contain essential shared libraries for system boot-up and running commands in root 
filesystem binaries, closely linked to the system libraries in the architecture.

/etc: Configuration files critical for the system's operation, 
which the kernel and various system utilities read at startup or during operation.


=> Linux Architecture Component: User and Shell Interface
/bin, /usr/bin: User binaries that include essential commands required for all users, 
such as ls, cp, etc., are necessary for user interaction with the shell.


/sbin, /usr/sbin: System administration binaries that are generally not run 
by ordinary users but require superuser (root) privileges, 
reflecting the administrative functions accessible through the shell.


=> Linux Architecture Component: User Data and Applications

/home: Home directories for user files, reflecting the user space in 
the architecture where each user's data and user-specific configurations are stored.

/usr/local: Local hierarchy for user-installed software and files, 
which is separate from system software and reflects the modularity of user applications within the architecture.


=> Linux Architecture Component: System Operation and Process Management

/var: Variable data files that include logs, spool files, and transient and temporary files, 
representing the system's ongoing operation managed by the kernel.

/proc: A virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files, 
directly representing the kernel's process management in a user-accessible format.

/dev: Device files representing hardware devices, which the kernel manages, 
providing the interface between the hardware (kernel management) and user-space utilities.


=> Linux Architecture Component: System State and Services

/run: Holds runtime data, like the system's state since the last boot, 
which is tightly coupled with the kernel's management of system state.

/sys: Another virtual filesystem that provides a window into the kernel, 
exposing the kernel's view of the hardware in a structured way similar to /proc.


Temporary Data

/tmp: Temporary files used by applications and the system, 
managed by the kernel's process and resource management functionality.
