Grep Lab Exercise for Software Developers

Objective: Apply `grep` to real-world software development scenarios.

Setup:
1. Consider you have a codebase with multiple `.py` (Python) files.
2. You've also got application logs (`app.log`) recording the behavior of your application.

Tasks:
1. Find all Python functions in the codebase that might be printing to the console.
2. Identify all error logs in `app.log`.
3. Search for all TODO comments in the codebase.
4. List all instances of a variable named `dbConnection` in the codebase, 
along with their line numbers.
5. Extract URLs (starting with "http:// or "https://") from `app.log`.
