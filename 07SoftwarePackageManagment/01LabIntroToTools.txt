Introduction to Tools

1. wget

Theory
Description: wget is a non-interactive downloader in Linux that retrieves files using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.

Usage:
Basic Syntax: wget [option]... [URL]...

Common Options:
-c: Continue getting partially downloaded files.
-O [filename]: Directs downloads to the filename provided.

Practical
Objective: Download the nano text editor source code.

Commands:

wget https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v5/nano-5.0.tar.xz

2. curl

Theory
Description: curl is utilized to transfer data from or to a server using various protocols.
Usage:
Basic Syntax: curl [options] [URL]...
Common Options:
-o [filename]: Write output to [filename] instead of stdout.
-u [user:password]: Authenticate with specified credentials.
Practical
Objective: Download a file and save it as example.txt.

Commands:
To download the HTML content of google.com using curl and save it to a file called google.html, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
curl -o google.html http://www.google.com

This will fetch the HTML content from Google's homepage and save it to a file named google.html in the 
current working directory. If you open this file with a text editor, you'll see the HTML that your web browser 
uses to render the Google homepage.

Please note that web scraping (i.e., programmatically downloading and processing web pages) 
should be done in compliance with the legalities and ethical guidelines, and it is important to 
respect the robots.txt file of a website, which provides guidelines on what you are allowed to access and download.


3. tar

Theory
Description: tar is used to create, maintain, modify, or extract files that are archived in the tar format.
Usage:
Basic Syntax: tar [options] [archive-file] [file or directory to be archived]
Common Options:
-c: Create archive.
-x: Extract archive.
-v: Verbosely show the .tar file progress in the terminal.
-f: Filename to archive.

Practical
Objective: Create a tarball of a directory and extract it elsewhere.

Commands:

mkdir example_dir
echo "This is a test file" > example_dir/test.txt
tar -cvf example_tarball.tar example_dir
mkdir extract_here
tar -xvf example_tarball.tar -C extract_here


4. gcc
Theory
Description: gcc is a compiler for languages including C and C++, and it's used to compile and link programs.

Usage:

Basic Syntax: gcc [options] [source files] [object files] [-Ldir] -llibname [-o outfile]
Common Options:

gcc -Wall -o hello hello.c
./hello


This lab provides a fundamental understanding and hands-on approach for 
utilizing wget, curl, tar, and gcc in a Linux environment. 
This foundational knowledge assists in managing packages, transferring data, archiving, and compiling source code.
