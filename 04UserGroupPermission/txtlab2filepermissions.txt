Lab2: Setting File Permissions

Step 1: Create Another User
Open the terminal and create a new user, 
for instance, dev_bob, but do not assign him to any group:

$ sudo useradd -m dev_bob


Set a password for dev_bob:
$ sudo passwd dev_bob

Step 2: Log In as dev_alex and Create a Python Script

Switch to the dev_alex user:
$ su - dev_alex

Create a Python script called hello.py using a text editor. Here, we'll use nano:

$ nano hello.py

print("Hello, dev_team!")

Save and exit the editor (for nano: Ctrl+O to write changes, Ctrl+X to exit).

Step 3: Change File Permissions
Set the file permissions so that only users in the dev_team group can execute the script. 
First, change the group ownership of the file to dev_team:

$ sudo chgrp dev_team hello.py

Next, set the file permissions to allow execution by the group:

$ chmod 770 hello.py

Step 4: Verify the File Permissions
Check the file permissions using the ls command:

$ ls -l hello.py
The output should indicate that the file owner and group members have read, write, and execute permissions, 
while others have no permissions.

Step 5: Test the File Execution
First, try executing the script as dev_alex:

$ python3 hello.py
You should see the output: "Hello, dev_team!"

Next, switch to the dev_bob user and try executing the script:

$ su - dev_bob
$ python3 /home/dev_alex/hello.py

dev_bob should not have the permissions to execute the script, and you should see a permission denied error.

Ok after a while Bob was promoted to become developer :)
in the final step we will add dev_bob to the dev_team group and demonstrate that he can now execute the script.

Step 6: Adding dev_bob to the dev_team Group
Switch back to a user with sudo privileges and add dev_bob to the dev_team group:

$ sudo usermod -aG dev_team dev_bob

Step 7: Verify the Group Assignment for dev_bob
Verify that dev_bob has been added to the dev_team group:

$ groups dev_bob

You should see dev_team in the list of groups for dev_bob.

Step 8: Log In as dev_bob and Execute the Script
Switch to the dev_bob user and execute the script:

$ su - dev_bob
Now, navigate to dev_alex's home directory and try running the script:

$ python3 /home/dev_alex/hello.py

This time, since dev_bob is a member of the dev_team group, 
he should be able to execute the script, and you should see the "Hello, dev_team!" message output to the terminal.
