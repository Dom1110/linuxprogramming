# Complete Linux Customization Tutorial: The Dotfile Movement and Practical Lab

## The Dotfile Movement

As you may have noticed, the default console in Linux isn't always the most user-friendly. Since there are few graphical interfaces for customizing the terminal, people have started experimenting with the appearance and functionality of the console through text-based configurations.

If you've watched tech-related videos or movies, you might have seen some really cool-looking terminal interfaces. This is often the result of customization through dotfiles.

In the Linux world, since there's no GUI for many settings, there's typically only one way to change the configuration of something: through text files. That's exactly what we're going to explore in this tutorial.

Fortunately for us, many enthusiasts kindly share their so-called "dotfiles" - configuration files (often starting with a dot, hence the name) used for changing settings of programs through direct text manipulation.

## Introduction to the Lab

In this lab, we'll dive into the world of dotfiles and Linux customization, starting with simple modifications and progressing to more advanced tweaks. We'll cover three levels of customization, from simple text changes to more complex prompt modifications. By the end of this lab, you'll have a personalized Linux environment tailored to your preferences.

## Lab Overview

- Part 1: Simple MOTD Customization
- Part 2: Command Alias Creation
- Part 3: Advanced Bash Prompt Customization

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Linux system (local or remote)
- Basic knowledge of terminal usage
- Text editor (nano will be used in this tutorial)

## Part 1: Simple MOTD Customization

In this part, we'll modify the Message of the Day (MOTD) to display a custom greeting when opening a terminal.

Steps:

1. Open the MOTD file:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/motd
   ```

2. Add the following two lines:
   ```
   Welcome to My Linux System!
   Have a great and productive day!
   ```

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

4. Test your change by opening a new terminal or running:
   ```
   su - $USER
   ```

## Part 2: Command Alias Creation

In this part, we'll create custom command aliases to simplify frequently used commands.

Steps:

1. Open your .bashrc file:
   ```
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   # Custom aliases
   alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
   alias ll='ls -alF'
   alias h='history'
   alias c='clear'
   ```

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

4. Apply the changes:
   ```
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Test your new aliases, for example:
   ```
   ll
   c
   h
   ```

## Part 3: Advanced Bash Prompt Customization

In this part, we'll customize the bash prompt using a script from Jess Fraz's dotfiles and add a time display.

Steps:

1. Download the bash prompt script:
   ```
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/master/.bash_prompt > bash_prompt.txt
   ```

2. Backup your existing .bashrc:
   ```
   cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.backup
   ```

3. Append the downloaded script to your .bashrc:
   ```
   cat bash_prompt.txt >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. Open your .bashrc file again:
   ```
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Add the following lines at the end of the file to display the current time in your prompt:
   ```bash
   get_current_time() {
       echo $(date +"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")
   }
   PS1+="\\[$white\\][\$(get_current_time)] ";
   ```

6. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)

7. Apply the changes:
   ```
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully customized your Linux environment in three different ways:
1. Created a custom welcome message
2. Set up useful command aliases
3. Customized your bash prompt with advanced features and time display

Feel free to further modify these customizations to suit your preferences. Remember, the key to mastering Linux is experimentation and continuous learning.
