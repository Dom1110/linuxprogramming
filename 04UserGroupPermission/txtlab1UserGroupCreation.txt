How to Create Users and Groups in Linux

Step 1: Open the Terminal
Open your terminal. You'll perform all the actions in this guide from the terminal.

Step 2: Creating a Group
Before creating a user, you may want to create a group. 
To create a group, use the groupadd command followed by the name of the group. 
Here, we create a group called dev_team:

$ sudo groupadd dev_team
You can verify that the group has been created by checking the file /etc/group:

$ grep dev_team /etc/group


Step 3: Creating a User

To create a user, use the useradd command followed by the username. 
Here, we create a user called dev_alex:

$ sudo useradd -m dev_alex
The -m option creates a home directory for the user.


Step 4: Setting a Password for the New User
Set a password for the new user using the passwd command:

$ sudo passwd dev_alex
You will be prompted to enter and confirm a password for the user. Don't forget it.

Step 5: Adding the User to a Group

To add the user to the group you created earlier, use the usermod command:
$ sudo usermod -aG dev_team dev_alex

The -aG option appends the user to the supplementary groups mentioned.

Step 6: Verify User and Group Assignment
Verify the user's details with the id command:
$ id dev_alex

The output will display the user's UID, GID, and the groups the user belongs to, 
confirming that the user has been added to the dev_team group.

Step 7: Switching to the New User
To switch to the new user's environment, use the su command:

$ su - dev_alex

You can then verify that you are logged 
in as dev_alex using:

$ whoami

#Before deleting make sure to finish lab2.

Step 8: Deleting Users and Groups
If necessary, users can be deleted with the userdel command, 
and groups can be deleted with the groupdel command:

$ sudo userdel dev_alex
$ sudo groupdel dev_team

Note: Be cautious when deleting users and groups, 
as this action can result in loss of data and system instability.

Conclusion
Now you know how to create, modify, and delete users and groups in Linux. 
It's always recommended to perform such actions with care to maintain system security 
and integrity. Practice these operations to get comfortable with 
user and group management in Linux. 

Once you feel ready, you can proceed with more advanced tasks like 
configuring file permissions and ownership.

P.S 
To list all users and groups on a Linux system.


Listing All Users

Using getent command:
$ getent passwd

Listing All Groups
Using getent command:
$ getent group



Notes:

/etc/passwd file: 
This file contains information about the users on the system. 
Each line in this file represents login information for one user.

/etc/group file: 
This file contains information about groups on the system. 
Each line in this file represents one group.

getent command: This command is used to get entries from Name Service Switch libraries, 
and it can be used to fetch details from passwd and group databases 
which read from /etc/passwd and /etc/group respectively, 
as well as other databases configured in the /etc/nsswitch.conf file.
